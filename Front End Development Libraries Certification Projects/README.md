  - Plays the audio clip when a drum pad is clicked or its corresponding key is pressed.
  - Displays the name of the audio clip in the `#display` element when a drum pad is triggered.

### 4. JavaScript Calculator

- **Description:** A web application that functions as a basic calculator for performing arithmetic operations.
- **Objective:** Build an application functionally similar to the example provided by freeCodeCamp: [JavaScript Calculator](https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/).
- **Features:**
  - Contains a clickable element with an id of `equals` for calculating results.
  - Includes 10 clickable number elements with IDs ranging from `zero` to `nine`.
  - Provides 4 clickable operator elements with IDs: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
  - Contains a clickable element with an id of `decimal` for decimal point input.
  - Includes a clear button with an id of `clear` to reset the calculator.
  - Displays input and results in an element with an id of `display`.
  - Supports chained operations and ensures proper order of operations.
  - Handles edge cases such as multiple zeros, consecutive operators, and decimal precision.

### 5. 25 + 5 Clock

- **Description:** A web application that functions as a Pomodoro-style timer with customisable session and break lengths.
- **Objective:** Build an application functionally similar to the example provided by freeCodeCamp: [25 + 5 Clock](https://25--5-clock.freecodecamp.rocks/).
- **Features:**
  - Displays session and break lengths with corresponding labels (`#session-label` and `#break-label`).
  - Includes increment and decrement buttons for session and break lengths.
  - Displays the timer with an id of `time-left` in `mm:ss` format.
  - Includes a `start_stop` button to start or pause the timer.
