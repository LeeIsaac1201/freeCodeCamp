      <h3 id="headline">Timeline</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Born in Oxford, England.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - With a degree in physics from the University of Oxford, he undertakes research in cosmology at Cambridge. Completes a doctorate thesis entitled "Properties of the Expanding Universes."</li>
        <li><strong>1963</strong> - Learns that he suffers from a form of the degenerative and paralysing motor-neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</li>
        <li><strong>1965</strong> - Marries his first wife, Jane Wilde, a modern languages student he met at Cambridge.</li>
        <li><strong>1966</strong> - Completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.</li>
        <li><strong>1967</strong> - The couple's first son, Robert, is born.</li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Jane gives birth to a daughter, Lucy. Along with Roger Penrose, he did ground-breaking work on singularities which proved their existence and theorized that the universe might have begun as a singularity.</li>
        <li><strong>1971</strong> - With James Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he discovered the four laws of black hole mechanics.</li>
        <li><strong>1974</strong> - His most significant theory is that black holes emit Hawking radiation. Elected as a fellow of the Royal Society at age 32, one of the youngest people to receive the honor.</li>
        <li><strong>1980</strong> - He was one of the first to calculate quantum fluctuations that were created during cosmic inflation and to show how they might give rise to the spread of galaxies in the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>1983</strong> - Along with James Hartle, he published a model known as the Hartle–Hawking state. It proposed that time didn’t exist before the Big Bang and hence the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.</li>
        <li><strong>1995</strong> - Divorces Jane Wilde and marries Elaine Mason.</li>
        <li><strong>2004</strong> - Announces that he has solved the Black Hole paradox.</li>
        <li><strong>2007</strong> - Divorces Elaine Mason.</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Given the highest civilian honour award in the US: the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</li>
        <li><strong>2018</strong> - Dies at the age of 76.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>"One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away."
      — <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong></p>
