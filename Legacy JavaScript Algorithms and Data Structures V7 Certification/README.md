## Projects
### 1. Palindrome Checker
Returns `true` if the given string is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise, where a palindrome is a word or sentence that is spelt the same way both forward and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

### 2. Roman Numeral Converter
Converts a given integer (1–3999) into an uppercase Roman numeral using a greedy subtraction algorithm.

### 3. Caesars Cipher
Decodes a ROT13-encoded string by shifting each uppercase letter by 13 places, while leaving all non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation) unchanged.

### 4. Telephone Number Validator
Returns `true` if the passed string matches a valid United States (U.S.) phone number format, and `false` otherwise, accepting a variety of formats via a single regular expression, with a required area code and an optional country code that must be 1 if provided.

### 5. Cash Register
A cash register function that accepts a purchase price, payment amount, and cash-in-drawer, then returns an object with a `status` and `change` key. Returns `OPEN` with the correct change, `CLOSED` if the drawer amount exactly equals the change due, or `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` if exact change cannot be made.

## Notes
1. As these projects are simple in scope, each project entry only contains a description. Sections such as Objectives, Features, Development Hints, and Example Usage, as seen in more complex projects, are not included.
2. No Technologies Used section is included as all projects are written in plain JavaScript with no external libraries or dependencies.
3. No How to Run Locally section is included, as all projects are standalone functions that can be copied and pasted directly into any JavaScript environment or code editor.
